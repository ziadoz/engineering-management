# Engineering Management For The Rest Of Us Notes

## Part 1 - Your Team

Being nervous is a good sign. Good managers know they affect other people’s work and careers and care about it. Bad managers are flippant about the role and its consequences.

Managers get interrupted from their flow, but enable uninterrupted flow for their team, by unblocking them or making decisions that keep things moving.

### Team Values

Values are fundamental beliefs that drive and motivate us. They also dictate people’s ethics and behaviour. They help us understand what is happening and why.

Conflicts are often a result of misaligned values rather than malice. Values are not as simplistic as good versus evil. If needs or requirements aren’t met or people aren’t communicating correctly, it can be detrimental.

Sharing values builds trust and vulnerability in a team. Helps to understand team member’s point of view, navigate conversations and hiccups.

Values stem from own experiences, which differ. Values can and do change with time. People can be inconsistent with their values, even if it’s not obvious to them.

Values aren’t to be weaponised, only to understand people. Hear the feelings and needs behind a message.

Ask team to pick five values from a list, and then elaborate on why they chose them. Gives a good idea of what each person values, aha moments as we understand each other. Leader can go first. Best done when things are uncomfortable. Personality tests are an alternative. (p6) Makes notes about what they say. Pay attention to any boundaries they set, and what drives that. Note which values overlap/intersect and which do not. Useful in feedback, managing conflict, 1:1s, prioritising.

Make a list of team values (p13). Helps teams figure out a way to support them, or push back if they don’t agree (better to find out before shit is hitting the fan). Values being upheld means there are no surprises.

If team members don’t fit in with values, it’s ok, they can find another team.

Building a team that share conguent values. Preference for collaborative values. Useful for career laddering.

Teams should share some fundamental value alignment. It doesn’t need to be exact, always useful to have new perspectives. Otherwise, it makes work tougher and leads to burnout.

Clarity of values is key.

### Own Values

Don’t need to follow other managers map. Need own values to be met in order to lead, otherwise you can’t help others.

Value misalignment can lead to burnout.

Unpacking own values helps us notice patterns in our life. Things that don’t feel right are often things we need to address.

Values can interplay with leadership style (mine is humour to some degree).

### Company Values

It’s crucial company values align with your own.

Sometimes companies' values are cultish or robotic, but done well, they help an organisation create a stable path and direction forwards (Fusions is the space to make mistakes and experiment without fear).

Good company values can be checked against and verified (e.g. Rackspace’s was “fanatical customer support” and Netlify’s was “good ideas can come from anywhere”).

### Values and Boundaries

Values are key to who you are, and you need to protect them. They determine who you let into your life, what actions you take and how you spend your time.

Boundaries around core values are necessary to protect yourself, and to avoid burnout (e.g. value work-life balance means also living life that way).

Immensely important to a work environment. Pay attention that you’re not violating your own/team values day-to-day.

There are no right or wrong answers with values. Good managers generally show care and appreciate for people’s values, and also respect their boundaries.
